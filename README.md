# PSI: A parallel library for Parallel Spatial Indexes
PSI is a high performance parallel library for a collection of spatial indexes, e.g., Kd-trees, Quad/Oct-trees and R-trees, which are:
- 🚀 Blazing fast;
- 🔀 Fully parallel;
- 📝 Provide strong theoretical guarantees for the running time, parallelism and I/O (cache) efficiency;
- 🛠️ Easy to adapt, integrate and deploy.
