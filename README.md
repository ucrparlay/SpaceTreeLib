# A library for spatial partition trees

## Requirements

Necessary:

- CMake >= 3.15
- g++ or clang++ with C++20 features support (Tested with g++13 and clang17) on Linux machines, we suggest clang++ for better performance.
- We use [ParlayLib](https://github.com/cmuparlay/parlaylib) to support fork-join parallelism and some parallel primitives. It is provided as a submodule in our repository.

Optional:

- [jemalloc](https://github.com/jemalloc/jemalloc), slightly memory allocation improvement.
- [NUMA control](https://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/trusty/man8/numactl.8.html), improve the performance for parallelism.

## Getting Code

Try:

1. Clone the repository.

```{bash}
git clone git@github.com:ucrparlay/KDtree.git
cd KDtree
```

2. Initialize the submodule:

```bash
git submodule update --init
```

File structure:

```bash

├── benchmark
├── include
├── parlaylib
├── script
└── tests
```

| `-i` |     Whether to read the file for batch update     |          `-i 0`          |

### Example

Under `build/` folder, first generate two inputs, $P_1$ for tree construction and $P_2$ for batch update:

```{bash}
./data_generator ../benchmark 10000 3 2 0
```

which will generate two files named `1.in` and `2.in` in `benchmark/10000_3/`. Then to build the tree $P_1$, insert $P_2$, after which perform the $10$-NN search, try:

```{bash}
./test -p ../benchmark/10000_3/1.in -d 3 -t 1 -q 1 -r 3 -i 1
```

To parse the output, see [ Test Framework Format ](#test-framework-format) below.

### Default setting

In default, the Pkd-tree stores all coordinates of points in 64-bit integer (`long`). The balancing parameter is set to $0.3$, the leaf wrap is $32$. It builds $6$ levels of tree at once. Different values on different machine may influence the performance dramatically. See our paper for more explanation.

## Test Framework Format

Implemented in `tests/testFramework.h`.

The test starts with $n$ input points $P$, and $\alpha\cdot n$ points $Q$ for insertion and deletion, where $\alpha\in[0,1]$. We also have one integer $t\in\{0,1,2\}$ marks the mode for batch operation before query and another integer $q$ stands for the type of query.

All outputs should be in one line, starts with the input file name and separated by a single space. If any output item is unavailable, outputs `-1` instead.

The execution flow is shown below:

1. Function `buildTree (t>=0)` builds a $k$d-tree $T$ over $P$.
   Outputs construction time and average tree depth separated by a single space.

2. Function `insert (t>=1)` insert $Q[0,\cdots, \alpha\cdot n]$ into $T$.
   Outputs insertion time.

3. Function `delete (t>=2)` delete $Q[0,\cdots, \alpha\cdot n]$ from $T$.
   Outputs delete time.

4. Query `q & (1<<0)` asks KNN of $P$ on $T$.

   If $t=0$, then $k=\{1,10,100\}$, otherwise, $k=10$.
   For each KNN, outputs time for query, average depth and average # nodes visited.

5. Query `q & (1<<1)` asks 10-NN w.r.t points $P'=\{P_0,\cdots,P_{1e6}\}$ (assume $|P|\geq 1e6$).
   For each KNN, outputs time for query, average depth and average # nodes visited.

6. Query `q & (1<<2)` asks range count on $T$ each with size $n = [0,n^{1/4}）, [n^{1/4}, n^{1/2}), [n^{1/2}, n)$
   For each query, outputs time for that query.

7. Query `q & (1<<3)` asks range query on $T$ with size $n$.

   If $t=0$, then $n = [0,n^{1/4}）, [n^{1/4}, n^{1/2}), [n^{1/2}, n)$, otherwise, $n=[n^{1/2},n)$.
   For each query, outputs time for that query.

   Same outputs as in 6.

8. Update `q & (1<<4)` insert $Q$ into $T$ incrementally with step $10\%$. $\alpha=1$.
   For each step, outputs the total time for such insertion.

9. Update `q & (1<<5)` delete $P$ from $T$ incrementally with step $10\%$. $\alpha=1$.
   For each step, outputs the total time for such deletion.

10. Update `q & (1<<6)` construct $T$ from $P$ incrementally using steps $[0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.5]$
    For each step, outputs the total construction time and the average tree depth.

11. Update `q & (1<<7)` first construct a tree $T'$ using $P\cup Q$, then delete $Q$ from $T'$ incrementally using steps $[0.1, 0.2, 0.25, 0.5]$
    For each step, outputs the deletion time and the average tree depth afterwards.

12. Query `q & (1<<8)` first construct a tree $T$ using $P$ and run a 10-NN on it, then construct another tree $T'$ from $P$ incrementally and perform a 10-NN on it.
    For each NN, outputs the total time, average depth and average # nodes visited.

13. Query `q & (1<<9)` first construct a tree $T$ using $P$ and run a 10-NN on it, then construct another tree $T'$ from $P\cup Q$, delete $Q$ from $T'$ incrementally, after which performs a 10-NN on it.
    For each NN, outputs the total time, average depth and average # nodes visited.
